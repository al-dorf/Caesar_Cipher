# Caesar_Cipher
A simple program that implements a Caesar cipher. 

The program prompts the user for input and output filenames,  reads a plaintext file, 
prompts the user for a key and performs the Caesar encryption, 
then writes the encrypted words to a ciphertext.

A test run was done with a plaintext file(plain.dat) with random words, encrypted with the Caesar Cipher 
function and then written to a ciphertext(cipher.dat) - using a key of 3.
